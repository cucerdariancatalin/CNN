# CNN
CNN stands for Convolutional Neural Network, a type of artificial neural network used in deep learning to process and classify images, videos and other multi-dimensional data. It is characterized by its use of convolutional layers, which are specialized in detecting features in images, followed by pooling layers to reduce dimensionality.
